Imaginary provides _no_ source-level compatibility from one release to the next.

Efforts will be made to provide database level compatibility (i.e. data from
one release can be loaded with the next).  However, although we will try to
ensure that data will load, there is no guarantee that it will be meaningfully
upgraded yet.
