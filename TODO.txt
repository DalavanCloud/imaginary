for this particular pull request to be complete:

    - we should be able to specify a 'world' (something that creates the
      initial world state) on the command line

        - possible options for this:

            1. a python file
            2. a fully-qualified module name
            3. a twisted plugin

    - some basic tests need to be added for the stuff in __main__

    - the README needs to be updated.
